<h1>Together in Lund - Milestone Project 1</h1>
_______________________

<h2>Purpose</h2>
The purpose of this website is to complete the first Milestone project for the Code Institute's Full Stack Developer course.

Together in Lund is a website for people living in Lund, Sweden who are interested in engaging in social activities. The site offers a one-stop-shop to activities in the city, organized by non gouvernemental organizations in Lund. 

<h2>User Experience</h2>
 Users will find information about different activities on the website for example type of activity, time and a sign up form. For a first time user, it has to be easy and desireble to sign up to an activity.

The site targets people who don't usually get involved in social activities, the site aims to be a fun way to enroll in an activity.

<h2>Testing</h2>
<h3>The tests</h3>
These are the tests that I did during the process:

<ul>
<li>I made sure that the hero image is big enough for large screens.</li>
<li>I tested the social media links and made sure they open in new tabs.</li>
<li>I tested the site on different browsers chrome, safari and explorer.</li>
<li>I tested the site on different screen sizes.</li>
<li>I tested the code in W3C HTML Validator and W3C CSS Validator (Jigsaw) a couple of times.</li>
<li>I tested the site's accessibility with Lighthouse.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bugs</h3>
Testing the html-code the first time, a warning of missing the language for the html-page came back in the W3C validator. I corrected the language to en-US. There was also a warning about the hero-image section missing a header, so I used a div-element instead. I added the video in html at first, but the testing came back suggesting that was obsolete so I ended up putting the video in css instead. having tried different options the link to youtube is still in html.

The W3C CSS Validator came back without any issues the first time.

<h2>Deployment</h2>
Since the basic idea of this site is to give easy access to people to join activities, I added different sized media queries so that the site can be easily accessed.

<h2>Credits</h2>
The site is built with the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. 

I have have taken inspiration from the Love running project and reused the code that I wrote for the forms section. 

<ul>
<li>Fonts from https://fonts.google.com/</li>
<li>Images from https://www.pexels.com/sv-se/</li>
<li>Symbols from https://fontawesome.com/</li>
<li>Colour-palette from https://coolors.co/</li>
<li>the video links to Lunds kommun youtube page</li>
</ul>

The hero-image is taken by Rodnae productions.

I would like to thank my mentor Ronan McClelland for his gudance throughout my project.
